        <p class="headertext">What is the <a href="https://www.lls.org/" target="_blank">Leukemia and Lymphoma Society</a>?</p>
    <p class="text">"Dedicated to curing leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, and other blood cancers, we are now The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS), the world's largest voluntary (nonprofit) health organization dedicated to funding blood cancer research and providing education and patient services.
Since 1949, we’ve invested nearly $1.5 billion in groundbreaking research, pioneering many of today’s most innovative approaches. We work tirelessly to find cures and ensure patients can access the lifesaving treatments they need. When someone experiences the fear and uncertainty of a cancer diagnosis, we provide hope, compassion, education and support. And we are making an impact in the cancer community."

    <p class="headertext">How Does LLS Relate to "A Letter to Brad"?</p>
    <p class="text">In his early 30s, Brad was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, which is a cancer in the white blood cells that attacks the body through the bones. This caused his bones to be brittle. He was originally given a life expectancy of 5 years and a 1% chance of survival. However, Brad was able to live until the age of 61.
       Throughout his battle, the LLS helped financially support Brad's treatment. Their research yielded medical advancments that also helped to prolong his life.<br><br>In Brad's honor, Candy and I will be donating 20% of the proceeds to LLS to support their continued research efforts.
