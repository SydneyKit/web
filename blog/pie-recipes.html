<p class="headertext">Baking is art, right?</p>
<p class="text">For those of you that are not familiar with my work, I am creating a comic series called <a href="../ColorTheory.html">"Color Theory"</a>, which is a comic series inspried by you, the audience. Every week I share a new color palette and invite my 
    audience to share what it reminds them of. I then create three individual comic strips inspired by the responses. <br><br>

    This week, the color palette inspired me to look into how to make the pies that were suggested. (I've been baking and cooking more now that I graduated college, so any new 
    recipes I can learn, I'm happy to try them!) 
<br><br>

I was fortunate enough to have enough time to make the key lime pie myself, but to also be able to create the comic to show the recipe. Although
my intention was to create a whole new comic strip for the Lemon Meringue Pie, it had way too many instructions to make a quick comic strip. If you make any of the pies, share pictures! Tag me on Instagram
or Facebook to show off your wonderful (and tasty) creations! <br><br>Without further ado, please
enjoy the recipe for Lemon Meringue Pie.</p>
