<p class="text">Thank you for scanning my graduation cap!
<br> <br>My name is Sydney Kit (she/her) and I am graduating today with a Bachelor in Fine Arts: Art & Technology.
Now, if you're wondering "What is she going to do with that?!", do not worry, I am already employeed full-time as a Marketing Coordinator for an Ohio business.

Over the past four and a half years, I have grown in my artistic skill, creating a range of pieces from comic books to animations. This website
was even created by me! It would mean a lot if you would take a moment to look around and see the work that I've done. <br>
<img src="../files/scottpilgrimversion_sydneykit.jpg" style="width: 45%; height: 45%;"><br>Some pieces to highlight are:<br><br>
<a href="../loveme/about.html"><i>Love, Me</i></a>: a comic book series that features short stories with advice submitted from the community (plus, you can find some free art to take there)<br>
<br> <a href="../ALaneyDay.html"><i>A Laney Day</i></a>: an animation series that features daily activities my dog does<br>
<br><a href="../galleryart.html">Gallery Art</a>: my pieces that have been featured in gallery shows<br>
<br><a href="../commission.html">Commissions</a>: a selection of commissions that I have done and how to commission your own (Christmas is coming up quickly)
<br>
