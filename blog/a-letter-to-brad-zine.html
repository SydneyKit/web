    <p class="headertext">An Introduction to the Introductory Zine</p>
    <p class="text">Making digital comics is intimidating to those artists that started out making comics traditionally, but what about the artists that started digitally switching to traditional?
        No more "ctrl+z", no more zooming into your detailed project, no more fancy brushes (unless you spend entire paychecks). So what did this digital artist do when she started a traditional 
        comic? Practiced!
    </p>

    <p class="headertext">Practice! Practice! Practice!</p>
    <p class="text">I knew that I needed the practice when it came to making traditioanl omics andd that I had several upcoming opportunities to get me work out into the world, so the natural answer
        was to make a free zine. Who doesn't love free art? Creating this sinze gave me the opportunity to practice my character design skills, my traditional comic making skills, and find questions
        I needed to have answered by the writer before starting the final project.

    <p class="headertext">What is a Zine?</p>
    <p class="text">"A zine is a self-published, non-commercial print-work that is typically produced in small, limited batches" according to <a href="https://www.binderymke.com/what-is-a-zine" target="blank">The Bindery</a>.
        In my case, I created a six paged comic, with two panels on each page, that introduced the characters. I then printed them out on my printer at home and folded them to appear like a mini comic book.
        It's an easy process, one that you can replicate now!
