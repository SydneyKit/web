<p class="headertext">Valentine's Day Is Right Around The Corner</p>
<p class="text">Valentine's Day is the day to buy your partner flowers and chocolate, right? Maybe take them out to a nice restuarant or give them a spa night at home.
    Those options are great options, but this year is the year to do something new. This is the year to commission art for your loved one.

<p class="headertext">Why Commission Art?</p>
<p class="text">Commission art is when you contact an artist and have them create something original for you rather than buying a preexisting piece of art. This gives you
    some control over the end product. Say you have an image you want an artist to replicate but your partner has a different hair color now or you want to be wearing different 
    clothes, you have that control by asking the artist to customize your art piece to your liking.

<p class="headertext">How Much Is Commissioned Art?</p>
<p class="text">Price depends on the individual artists and the medium you choose. Paints and canvas cost the artist money to buy, but creating a digital piece requires no additonal
    artist supplies. I charge anywhere from $25 to $100 for pieces that are sized 8 inches by 11.5 inches. However, from now until February 4th, 2022 at 11:59pm EST, I am offering 20% off all Valentine's Day
    commissions! <b>Just use the code "VDAY2022"</b>.
