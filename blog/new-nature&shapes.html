<p class="text">Two weeks ago I opened up a call to my audience to suggest new combinations for the <a href="../Nature&Shapes.html"><i>Nature&Shapes</i> series</a>, a series that started
  five years ago. Together, we were able to create six new wonderful designs that are now available as <a href="https://www.etsy.com/SydneyKit/listing/1120429734/natureshapes-greeting-cards?utm_source=Copy&utm_medium=ListingManager&utm_campaign=Share&utm_term=so.lmsm&share_time=1651465913801">greeting cards</a> 
  and <a href="https://www.etsy.com/SydneyKit/listing/1134377273/variety-stickers-animal-stickers-plant?utm_source=Copy&utm_medium=ListingManager&utm_campaign=Share&utm_term=so.lmsm&share_time=1651466322868">stickers</a>.

<p class="text"><i>Nature&Shapes</i> started based on curiosity, but now it has evolved into an art series based on audience participation. I knew that I wanted to create
more greeting cards so I wanted to create new paintings with that intention. This allowed me to create the paintings with the right size to create a gorgeous 
set of greeting cards. While the other paintings are available as greeting cards, this new series was produced with a higher quality, allowing stunning cards to use for any occasion.</p>

<p class="headertext">Now is the perfect time to order!</p>
<p class="text"> There are several opportunities to send cards this time of year with graduations, Mother's day, sending "thank you" cards, writing to a pen pal,
  and more! The cards come blank so you can use them for any occasion or you can request to have a message printed inside.<br>
<img src="../files/Nature&Shapes_stickers.jpg" style="width: 75%; height: 75%;"><br><br>The time to order for Mother's Day and college graduations are now! For high school graduations, order by May 21st to get the cards in on time. 
There are a couple of in-person oppotunities to get the cards in Columbus. Come see me at the Columbus Alt Art Book Fair at Weinland Park May 7th and 8th from 12pm to 5pm.
Then, at Brewdog Short North on May 15th from 1pm to 6pm. Cards and stickers will be limited at these events but can still be ordered online.</p>
