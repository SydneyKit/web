<p class="text">So the initial board/ mural project was not going to work. I was defeated and ready to come up with a backup plan
    for my class. I called John and Rose to let them know the official word I had recieved.
  <br><br> 
  John was not deterred at all. He said that this can still work and while he talked, more ideas popped into my head. At the end of 
  the call, we had come up with the idea to create boards similar to the cafe boards so that they were semi-permanent instead of a 
  permanent structure.
   <br><br> A new proposal was created:

The next step was for me to meet more of the community at their parish picnic on September 12th. I am making sure designs are 
completed and available for the community to look at during the picnic.
