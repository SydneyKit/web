<p class="text">On July 30th, I received an email from John, whom I had previously worked with, requesting a call about an art project.
  Intrigued, I called him as soon as I read the email. John explained that he and his wife, Rose, volunteer at the St. John Food Pantry
  and John was wanting to make the outside area more inviting for those who come to the pantry. 
  <br><br> 
  My ideas were instantly flowing and it landed on the creation of a mural. I had no idea where or what it was going to be, so I 
  needed to do my research. My partner and I went the next Thursday to help volunteer at the food pantry. While our intentions were to 
  check out the area a little bit and mostly help, it ended up being mostly a tour of the entire property. John's tour made my head start 
  filling up with ideas.
 <br> <br><br> We ended the tour and I went home and immediately started sketching. I later proposed the following document:

<br>
<br>
John loved the idea so we started to make plans. I reached out to my grandpa, who is my go to person when it comes to building,
  and he helped me realize that I was missing a whole step... I had to reach out to zoning to get approval. I have started the conversation
  by reaching out via email and reaching out to the location's community's group on FaceBook for advice. Now, we wait for responses.
